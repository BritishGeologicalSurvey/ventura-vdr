          Water flow refers to the volume of water that is moving through a particular point or section of a river,
          stream, or other waterway. It is measured in m3/day.

          The term ‘Excess Water’ is currently conceptualised as that part of fallen precipitation which has not
          infiltrated into groundwater. In this version of WSIMOD, it is calculated as the sum of stormwater discharge
          to a subcatchment’s outlet and the surface runoff in the same subcatchment. Climate change can increase the
          amount of excess water as a result of increased rainfall.

          Water quality refers to the chemical characteristics of water that determine its suitability for specific
          uses, such as drinking, swimming, or irrigation. The three indicators for water quality are ammonia,
          phosphorous and nitrogen.
